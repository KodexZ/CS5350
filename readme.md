This is a machine learning library created for the University Of Utah : CS5350/6350
To learn a decision tree, simply pass the appropriate parameters into the DecisionTree class in DecisionTree.py. Note that the output column must be named 'P'. I will get around to changing this when I have time...

To learn different ensemble classifiers, go to the appropriate file and set parameters in the methods. You can then read in your csv file and make predictions with the predict methods

To run batch and stochastic gradient descent, go to the appropriate file, set your learning rate, and pass in your csv.
